    <h2>Fido is real</h2>
    <h3 class="liner">And he loves me very much</h3>
    <p class="entry">Fido, my doggy, is very real. My friends say that my family shouldn't "indulge my sad little fantasy. If only I didn't live in a tiny apartment, I could have a dog, a garden, a place for my tools. A boy can dream, eh? Speaking of which... C'mere boy! Let's go for a walk!</p>

    <h2>Fido's first bone</h2>
    <h3 class="liner">He ate it very quickly!</h3>
    <p class="entry">Fido got a lot of strange stares as we walked through the neighborhood. Someone even yelled at him. "You need help mister! Walking an empty leash! Go see someone!". He must have been talking to Fido. The mailman, as usual, refused to give Fido a treat. I tried to hide my disappointment on behalf of Fido, but I think <strong>I didn't hide it very well.</strong> The mailman gave me the treat instead.</p>

    <h2>Cold Stone Whoopsie Doo</h2>
    <h3 class="liner">Fido was not very good today</h3>
    <p class="entry">Fido had an accident in the mall yesterday. We were walking by when it occurred to me that I wanted some Cold Stone Creamery. So we walked in and as I thought about my order, standing in line, Fido made an oopsie. The other people in line moved away quickly. One said they were calling the police. I didn't want to leave without my ice cream, but it was apparent <strong>Fido had ruined my chance.</strong></p>

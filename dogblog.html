      <p class="entry">Fido, my doggy, is very real. My friends say that my family shouldn't "indulge my sad little fantasy." If only I didn't live in a tiny apartment, I could have a dog, a garden, a place for my tools. A boy can dream, eh? Speaking of which... C'mere boy! Let's go for a walk!</p>

      <p class="entry">Fido had an accident in the mall yesterday. We were walking by when it occurred to me that I wanted some Cold Stone Creamery. So we walked in and as I thought about my order, standing in line, Fido made an oopsie. The other people in line moved away quickly. One said they were calling the police. I didn't want to leave without my ice cream, but it was apparent <span class="odd">Fido had ruined my chance.</span></p>
